Code has not been tested in a long time, A Migration Report or UpgradeLog may be presented if this is open in Visual Studio.

This project shows an example of a legacy Windows 10 UWP *Project Westminster* App app using Houzz as an example website. `windows.js` serves as the driver for all Windows 10 API interactions, like toast notifications, Cortana dialog etc. Also included is a TestServer and fwa (future web apps) template for interacting with the Windows 10 API in JavaScript.
